# Forum app

Register a account, create a topic and start discussing with other users!

You have access to all other topics/conversations and messages!

Send messages and get notifications if another user sends a message!

The app works offline too!


## Information for setup / usage:

1. Variable for IP adress found in MainActivity

2. Everyone can see all messages ->
    * all messages get send from our app to receiverId = 1
    * that means that only messages get displayed if they got sent to receiverId = 1 (in case the server has already data in it, it will not be displayed correctly)
